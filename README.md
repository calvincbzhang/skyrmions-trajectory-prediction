# Skyrmions Trajectory Prediction

This repository contains the code for the research project I conducted during the summer of 2020 together with professors at the University of Manchester and a PhD students in the department of Computer Science.

The project aimed to analyze the behavior of quasi-particles called skyrminons in a simple ferro-magnet.
